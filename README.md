### **Documentation: Building an AWS Architecture Diagram on draw.io**

This tutorial will guide you through the steps to create an AWS architecture diagram using **draw.io**, including how to save your work and how to delete a file from **Google Drive**.

---

### **Step 1: Create a Diagram**

#### 1.1 **Access Draw.io**

* Open your browser and navigate to [**draw.io**](https://app.diagrams.net/).
* You'll be prompted to choose where to store your diagram:

  * **Device** – Save the diagram to your local system.
  * **Google Drive / OneDrive / Dropbox** – If you'd prefer to save it in the cloud, select one of these options.

Choose your preferred option and click **Create New Diagram**.

#### 1.2 **Choose a Template (Optional)**

* **Blank Diagram**: Start with a clean slate. Ideal for custom designs.
* **AWS Architecture**: If available, select an AWS-specific template from the list. This will provide icons and resources specific to AWS.

If no AWS template is available, you can always add AWS icons manually in later steps.

#### 1.3 **Setting Up AWS Icons**

If you want to use AWS-specific icons, you will need to:

1. **Import AWS Icons**:

   * Go to the **Shape Library** on the left side.
   * Click **More Shapes**.
   * In the pop-up window, scroll down and check the option for **AWS** (you might need to search for AWS in the shape categories).
   * Click **Apply** to add the AWS shapes to your library.

2. **Select AWS Shapes**:

   * You’ll see icons for **EC2**, **S3**, **VPC**, **RDS**, **Lambda**, and other AWS resources in the shape library.
   * Drag and drop these AWS shapes onto the drawing area to represent various components of your architecture.

#### 1.4 **Build the Architecture**

* **Drag and Drop**: Start dragging icons (AWS services) into the diagram. For example:

  * **EC2 Instances** to represent virtual machines.
  * **S3 Buckets** to represent storage.
  * **VPCs**, **Subnets**, and **Internet Gateways** to represent networking infrastructure.
* **Connect Components**: Use the **connector tool** (a line with arrows) to link components and show data flow or network architecture.

#### 1.5 **Customize the Diagram**

* **Resize and Rotate**: Click and drag to resize or rotate the icons to fit your needs.
* **Text Labels**: Click on any component to add a text label. This is useful for labeling services or resources (e.g., “Production Web Server” or “Database”).
* **Color Coding**: Right-click on any shape, go to **Format Panel**, and choose a color to differentiate components (e.g., use blue for compute, green for databases, etc.).

### **Step 2: Save the Diagram**

#### 2.1 **Save to Device or Cloud Storage**

* **Save the progress**:

  1. Open **Google Drive** in your web browser ([drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com)).
  2. Locate the doc1 file.
  3. Right-click on the file and select **Remove**. This will move the file to the **Trash**.

#### 2.2 **Export and Delete the Diagram (From Google Drive)**

* **Export the Diagram**:

  1. Go to **File** > **Export As**.
  2. Choose the file format (e.g., **PNG**, **PDF**, **JPEG**).
  3. Adjust any settings (e.g., transparency, size, or margins).
  4. Click **Export** and save the file to your device.


#### 2.3 **Version Control (Optional)**

If you're collaborating with others, you can keep track of version history using the cloud storage (Google Drive/Dropbox/OneDrive). Every time you make changes and save, the cloud service will automatically update the version history.
